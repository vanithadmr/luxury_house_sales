Project Deliverables:
    Read the data from csv format and convert it to the data frame using pandas 
    Understanding the data , like how many columns ,rows, datatypes, then identifying the required target column and all of that.
    Some columns are incorrect format, after that I corrected the data type for those columns. 
    Removing the unwanted symbols from the target column.
    Getting the idea about null values and imputing median values in those columns.
    The target column also has null values. We cannot impute so that drop the rows 
    Also done for Feature Engineering from the existing data.

    Made a live connection between SQL and power BI using DAX measure created interactive Dashboard.
